<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

In this project I have created a full stack web application for my niece to track information on her wedding guests. When I was planning my wedding 19 years ago, I had a spiral bound wedding planner. I used this planner throughout the process, from planning the big day up until the last thank you was written. I have even referenced it over the years. My goal was to create an electronic version of my spiral bound book. My niece can start using it right away to work on compiling her master guest list. Once she has the list provided, she will be able to use the app to keep track of when she mails her wedding invite. She will also be able to track which guests RSVP'd with a "Yes" and the number of people attending. The app allows her to log any shower and wedding gifts she receives from each guest, as well as indicate if she has sent a thank you note to the person. I've included the functuality for her to be able to view the entire guest list on one page. She will also be able to view a summary page for each guest. This will allow her to keep an eye on which guests have not RSVP'd to the wedding invitation.

The application is still a little rough around the edges. However, it still accomplishes what I initially set out to do. My niece has an electronic version of my spiral bound wedding planner.

User Stories:
As a bride I want to be able to:

 - Enter an address for each of the guests.
 - In instances where multiple people from the same address will be attending, I only want to enter the mailing address once.
 - Delete a guest.
 - Track from which guests I have received an RSVP.
 - Know the number of people that will be attending for people with an RSVP of 'Yes'.
 - Keep track of any wedding or shower gift I receive from a guest.
 - Track whether or not I have sent a Thank You card for any wedding/shower gift I receive.
 - View a complete guest list.
 - View a summary page for each guest.
 - Edit the information as needed.
