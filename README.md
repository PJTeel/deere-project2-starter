<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
User Stories:
As a bride I want to be able to:
 - Add guests to the guest list.
 - Enter an address for each of the guests.
 - In instances where multiple people from the same address will be attending, I only want to enter the mailing address once.
 - Delete a guest.
 - Track from which guests I have received an RSVP.
 - Know the number of people that will be attending for people with an RSVP of 'Yes'.
 - Keep track of any wedding or shower gift I receive from a guest.
 - Track whether or not I have sent a Thank You card for any wedding/shower gift I receive.
 - View a complete guest list.
 - View a summary page for each guest.
 - Edit the information as needed.
